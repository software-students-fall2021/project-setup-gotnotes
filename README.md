# GotNotes: A Course Note Sharing Website (and mobile app) for college students.
Proposal by H. Atacan Demir

### What is GotNotes?

GotNotes is an online platform for college students to create communities around shared classes and share class notes.

### Why GotNotes?

As college students, we have all spent hours in various note sharing websites like Chegg, CourseHero, etc. to find that *specific* document we need to study for an upcoming exam. <br /><br />
How often did we find what we were looking for? <br />
**Not that often.** <br /><br />
How often were we able to create a community to ask and answer questions with our peers? <br />
**Almost never.**<br /><br />
Were we bombarded with ads that forced us to pay something to get something? <br />
**Every Single Time!** <br /><br />

You'll suffer no longer my friend, GotNotes is here to save you!

### For whom?

This is for all college students who are fed up with currently existing course note sharing platforms that prey on students by asking for a payment for any useful feature that we could need.

### How?

The how is *simple*:
* Sign Up
* Select a University
* Browse the Course Catalogue
* Subscribe to the Courses You Are Taking
* Get the New Notes that Are Shared in your Feed
* Share your Notes
* And Chat with Your Classmates in the Course Group Chat that GotNotes automatically creates!

The *question* is **what are you waiting for?!?**

### Scope

These will be implemented:
* file upload and download systems that supports jpeg, pdf, doc, docx, pages.
* live chat rooms with websocket
* easy to use, minimalist, modern, and mobile friendly layout with reactjs.
* Login/Sign-up Page
* Page with College and Course Selection lists
* Page with subscribed courses and lists of documents shared to that course
* Live Chat rooms page with the User's subscribed courses
* authentication using google, facebook.
* If time permits, we will convert the project to a react native project and use expo for development purposes. At the end, we could have a cross platform app and a website!!
