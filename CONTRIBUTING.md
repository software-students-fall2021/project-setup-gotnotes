# Guide to Contributing

## Team norms

- Be present in the Zoom meetings that are set up on our Slack Channel or group text
- Be respectful of other teammates
- Make sure to let other teammates know in advance if you will fall short of completing a task, so that that task can be delegated to another teammate.
- Don't shy away from giving constructive criticism towards the betterment of the project


### Team values

- We work together by creating issues and prioritizing those issues and taking on equal amounts of workload and divide up the todo and backlog columns of our task board.
- We send messages on our slack channels or text-message groups to ask for help from other team members
- We resolve conflicts by voting on them.
  - We try to reach a unanimous decision by tweaking different proposals and create a concensus by 
  - If a member is failing to meet theire requirements, for the good of the project, the unfinished responsibilities will be divided among the other developers, and the course of action that is to be taken for the developer falling behind will be decided upon a vote of the other developers.
  - Team members are expected to respond to messages directed at them within a two hour time-frame. This should be doable by all of our developers, taking into account that a lecuter is on average 1 hours 15 minutes long.

### Sprint cadence

Sprints are 1 week long


### Daily standups

- Daily standups will occur everyday at 12:00pm
- members are expected to be present in the slack channel and covey over text what they have been completed and what they will complete before the next standup
- members will cover for other members who are not present
- a member who has not been making progress for two standups will be reported to management


### Coding standards


- Fetch all remote repo data
- Pull the latest from the main branch
- Create your won branch and work on your code
- Synch your changes on your own branch regularly so that other developers can see your progress through the remote repo
- Create a PR
- If any conflicts arise create an issue for review
- We use VSCode and es-lint for coding and linting, we will use reactjs-code-snippets extension on vscode for react related code snippets
- Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve. Don't divide code into react components just for the sake of using react components. Only create new components if it makes sense logically.
  - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code.
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).


### Contributing for Developers not in our Team

- The GotNotes team creates issues with relevant labels and creates branches to work on those issues. We peer-review each other's code.
- Of you'd like to contribute, please fork the repo and then create a pr and one of our teammates will review the pr and if the pr is inline with our vision and meets our coding standards, we will accept the issue. If we do not accept a pr, We will provide detailed answers for why that pr was not accepted.
- specifics about the local environment stup will be detailed later
- building and testing information will be given at a later date


### Concluding thoughts

Overall, please be responsive over our communication channels and if you are stuck please feel free to reach out to other team members. Please create
